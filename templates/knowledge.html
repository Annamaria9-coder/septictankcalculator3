            <p>Welcome to the knowledge guide for septic tank design! Here, you'll learn about the basics of septic tanks, including their purpose, components, and considerations for designing an efficient system.</p>
            
            <h3>What is a Septic Tank?</h3>
            <p>A septic tank is an underground system that treats wastewater from households. It separates waste into three layers: <strong>scum</strong> (top layer), <strong>liquid effluent</strong> (middle layer), and <strong>sludge</strong> (bottom layer).</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Septic Tanks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3-Chambered Septic Tank:</strong> Used when effluent is absorbed into the soil via a leach field.</li>
                <li><strong>4-Chambered Septic Tank:</strong> Includes a final chamber for treated water to be reused.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Factors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wastewater Flow:</strong> Average wastewater flow per person ranges between 50–200 L/day.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention Time:</strong> Retention time is typically 1–2 days to allow for proper separation and treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Determines the absorption rate in the leach field:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sandy soils: High percolation rates (100+ L/m²/day).</li>
                        <li>Loam soils: Moderate percolation rates (20–60 L/m²/day).</li>
                        <li>Clay soils: Low percolation rates (5–20 L/m²/day).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mixed Media Filtration</h3>
            <p>Mixed media, such as sand, charcoal, and coconut husks, further filter the effluent before it exits the septic tank. Each layer performs a specific function, such as reducing odor or filtering solids.</p>
            
            <h3>Environmental Safety</h3>
            <p>Ensure the septic tank is located at a safe distance from water sources like boreholes to prevent contamination. Groundwater flow direction and depth are critical considerations.</p>
